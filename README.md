# sloceries

A new Flutter project designed for people that do not own cars. A environmentally friendly way to go grocery shopping. People with cars will post the date and time they are planning to go grocery shopping, the number of seats in their car, and the stores they plan to go to. People can join their carpool and direct message them before, during, and after the trip. 

Created at the SLOHacks GO hackathon.
